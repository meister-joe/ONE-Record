Following are a few guidelines on how to write the Data Model ontology to be compliant with JOPA. These guidelines are to be updated if new constraints are found.

#########
### Maximum number of lines for Restrictions on properties linked to classes
#########

JOPA does not handle properply Restrictions that contain more than 3 lines. When defining the properties of a class the restrictions need to be split accordingly.

For instance the following:

	[ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
		owl:onProperty address:country ;
		owl:maxCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
		owl:onClass :Country
	]
						 
Should be written:

	[ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
		owl:onProperty address:country ;
		owl:maxCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
	] ,
	[ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
		owl:onProperty address:country ;
		owl:onClass :Country
	]

#########
### Defining cardinality restrictions for properties
#########

Protege defines cardinality in a different way than JOPA handles. maxQualifiedCardinality, minQualifiedCardinality and qualifiedCardinality should not be used. Only maxCardinality and minCardinality should be used.

In case there is exactly one, or any other number, expected value(s) it should be written:

	[ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
		owl:onProperty address:country ;
		owl:maxCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
	] ,
	[ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
		owl:onProperty address:country ;
		owl:minCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
	]
